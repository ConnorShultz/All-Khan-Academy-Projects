        <h1>Happy Halloween!!!</h1>
        
       Dear Mom and Dad, <br>
      <br>
       
       I <strong><em>love</em></strong> Halloween, and I hope we can be together to celebrate it by...
       
<h2>Decorating the House! </h2>

<br>
<p> Decorating the house is one of my <strong><em>all</em></strong> time favorite things to do arround halloween, and I hope <strong> you guys </strong> can help me this year! </p>

<h3> What I want to decorate with you guys!</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Putting the tombstones in the ground!
    <li> Placing the skeletons on the roof!
    <li> Putting the little skull fences in the grass!
    <li> And finally, blowing up the mega inflatable Ghost!
</ul>

<h2> Eating Pumpkin Pie!</h2>

<br>
<p> Eating delicious pumpkin pie is my absolute favorite sweet around Halloween! I even prefer it more than <strong> CHOCOLATE!!!</strong> I want you guys to enjoy pumpkin pie with me this Halloween! </p>
<h2> Spending Time Together!</h2>

For me, Halloween is not only about the food and the candy, but it is the experience of spending time together as a <strong><em>family</em></strong>. 

<h3> This halloween, we would bond through... </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Decorating!
        <li> Eating!
        <li> Giving out candy to the children of the neighborhood!
        
    </ul>

<h2> Eating A Nice Turkey Dinner!</h2>

<p> On Halloween's eve or on Halloween, no meal is better than eating a nice stuffed turkey as a familly with some fresh vegetables on the side! </p>

<h2> Watching Halloween Movies Together!</h2>

<p> Finally, Watching movies together as a family on Halloween is a special time because it is a time where we can all sit down together and enjoy the presence of eachother. Much like supper, it is a time where we can bond and enjoy being together.
